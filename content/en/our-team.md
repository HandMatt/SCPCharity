## Consultant
### Tony Ricketts
### Founder and Head of Education and Life Skills at **Sporting Chance Project**
Tony is the Founder and Head of Education and Life Skills at **Sporting Chance Project**, an Alternative Learning Provision provider offering mentoring, education, and life skills coaching to children and young people with **Special Educational Needs (SEN)** or an **Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP)**.

Tony originally planned to transition Sporting Chance Project into a charity to support more SEN children and young people when funding was unavailable from schools or local councils. However, he was advised that establishing a new charity would be more effective, and **Supporting Children's Pathways** was born.

Tony now acts as a **Consultant** for Supporting Children's Pathways and has stepped aside from a Trustee role to avoid any conflict of interest.
