### Mission Statement

At **Supporting Children's Pathways**, we believe every child and family deserves the opportunity to thrive. Our mission is to support children and families facing educational and life challenges by providing access to **quality education**, **alternative learning pathways**, and a **nurturing community**. We proudly support families in **Bristol, Bath and surrounding areas**, ensuring that **no formal diagnosis** is needed to receive our support. Through mentorship and educational programs, we aim to break the cycle of poverty and empower the next generation with the skills and confidence to build a brighter future. Together, we can create lasting change, one child, one family, and one community at a time.

### Our Approach

Not every child, especially those with **Special Educational Needs (SEN)**, fits within the UK's traditional school education system. Many thrive in **alternative learning**, which could include:

        - A mentor working one-on-one with a child
        - A group of children participating in life skills coaching
        - Hands-on vocational experiences, like construction or catering
        - PRT

- **One-to-one mentoring or tuition**
- **Life skills coaching**
- **Vocational hands-on experience**, including construction, catering, and more
- **Primitive Reflex Therapy** (Health & Movement Brain Training), a movement-based program that helps improve brain development and sensory-motor skills, currently only available through private funding

We also assist families in creating **Education Health and Care Plans (EHCP)** for children who need them, ensuring they receive the additional support required in school or alternative learning environments. Schools and local authorities are struggling and often lack funding to support these children and young people in accessing these services. **Supporting Children's Pathways** aims to fill this gap through our fundraising efforts and your generous donations, allowing us to provide critical funding that benefits children, young people, their families and their communities.

### Grant Provision

Our organisation operates by providing **Grants** to service providers who support children and young people ages **6 to 25 years old**, regardless of whether they have a SEN diagnosis or an EHCP. An EHCP is a legal document arranged by the local authority that outlines the additional support needed to meet educational, health, and social needs. 

Grant applications can be submitted by various entities, including:
- **Families**
- **Service providers**
- **Schools**
- **Local authorities**
- **Social workers**
- **Youth offending teams**
- **Child and adolescent mental health services**
 
While the charity remains small, each application will be reviewed and deliberated on by the [**Trustees**](/our-team/#our-trustees) before funding decisions are made.
