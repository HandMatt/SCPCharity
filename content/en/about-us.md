As reported by **ITV News**, as of December 2024, **1.6 million children and young people in the UK** are waiting for an **Education Health and Care Plan (EHCP)**. An EHCP is a **legal document** arranged by local authorities, outlining the additional support required to meet a child's educational, health, and social needs. Unfortunately, education services are underfunded, and **waiting times for EHCP reviews often exceed 12 months**. 

We believe this is unacceptable, as it can severely impact a young person's development. That's why, in **2024**, we founded Supporting Children's Pathways with a clear mission: **to ensure every young person has access to an education that meets their unique needs and empowers them to thrive**.

### The Problem:
The current education system is underfunded and struggling to meet the needs of all children, especially those with SEN. Long delays in EHCP processing leave many families feeling unsupported, while young people miss out on critical opportunities for growth.
