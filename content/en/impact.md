Thank you for your interest in the impact of Supporting Children's Pathways! We are currently in the process of compiling information about our achievements and the difference we make in the lives of children and young people with Special Educational Needs (SEN).

**Stay tuned!** We'll be adding content soon to showcase our programmes, success stories, and the positive changes we are creating within the community.

In the meantime, feel free to explore our other pages to learn more about our [mission](/about-us) and [team](/our-team)!
